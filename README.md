## General Information
- Confess helps reduce the burden your heart and mind are carrying. Because you are anonymous, you can confess anything without worrying about other people's thoughts. Only that confession will be displayed when you confess, and your identity will remain hidden.
- I wanted to build a full stack application, that's why decided to build this.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
