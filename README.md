## Features
List the ready features here:
* In Overflow Mode, you can play without any boundary, but be careful not to eat yourself, or your snake will die. The game gets more challenging as your snake grows longer, and you'll have to use your skills to navigate through the maze-like screen without crashing into yourself.
* In Underflow Mode, you won't be able to cross the boundaries, so you'll have to be extra careful not to touch the walls. The challenge increases as you progress, and you'll have to use your reflexes and quick thinking to avoid crashing into the walls or eating yourself.
* In Red Bit Mode, you'll be able to play without any boundary, but there's a catch - in addition to dying on eating yourself, your snake will also die on eating the red bit. So, you'll have to be extra careful and avoid the red bits if you want to keep playing and get a high score.
* You can check your high score in each of the three modes and challenge yourself to beat your own record. And if your snake dies, don't worry, you can revive it with the same score by spending the bits you've collected or watching an ad.
* If you don't like the background music, then you can turn it off in the Settings page.
